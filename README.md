Take a quick survey and get paired up with your most compatible match.

## How it Works
Express routing is used to display the web pages and handle data. Survey data is collected and stored on the app's server. After the user takes the survey, the app checks the server again and compares the user's scores to previous survey takers, displaying the user with the greatest compatibility.
